Optimizations for Elementor Canvas page template when used with Genesis.


## Features & Description:

You can easily use Elementor with Genesis of course. However, when using the "Elementor Canvas" page template you're losing the inherited theme styles of your Genesis Child Theme. This plugin just changes that. If you have disabled the global colors and styles in Elementor (which I recommend in most cases) then this plugin here manages that the Genesis styles of your child theme are enqueued properly.

Also, the plugin keeps Genesis body class support, Genesis script support for pages/ posts/ post types intact.

Just activate the plugin and you are done. Simple as that.
